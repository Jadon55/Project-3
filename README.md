### Map
- Clusters nearby crashes together
- Moveable and Zoomable
- Only shows crashes in bounds of the map (for efficiency)
  - Adds and Removes crashes when needed
### Year / Location
- Select the year to graph
- 4 quick travel links to notable locations in New Zealand
### Stats
- Only shows stats for crashes shown on the map.
  - Updates when the map is moved or zoomed, or when a new year is selected
### Crashes by Holiday
- Pie graph comparing the number of crashes that occur during a holiday period
  - *Note: does not graph crashes that happened not in a holiday period*
### Crashes by Year
- Bar graph of the total count of crashes per year
### Public Transport Expense
- Bar graph of the amount of money New Zealand spent on public Transportation per year

  - the number of injuries
- Color of the tower
  - Severity of the crash (green = no injuries, yellow = minor injuries, red = fatial)
