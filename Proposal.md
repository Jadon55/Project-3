# Project Proposal
## Executive Summary
According to a 2018 study conducted by FIGURES NZ (image 1), Motor Vehicles accidents are the leading cause of accidental injury death in New Zealand. This projects aims to explore road accident data from the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) and identify key trends involved in crashes over a 5 year period (2018 - 2022).

</br>
The following questions will be investigated to highlight this issue, in the hopes that the findings can help mitigate future accidents:

1. How many crashes were logged over the 5 year period?
2. Are the number of crashes per year increasing or decreasing?
3. Which public holiday is the most dangerous for drivers?
4. Do any common geographical accident zones stand out?
5. Which region has the most fatalities on the road?
6. What are the most common factors leading to crashes?

The findings will be presented on an interactive dashboard with graphs/plots and an interactive map plotting the logged road accidents.

## The Data
The dataset we will be working from is the Crash Analysis System data provided by the NZTA to the public at: </br> 

https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/crash-analysis-system-cas-data5/resource/1b5d64f2-ed66-4b72-b4c3-c87e43ced5bd?inner_span=True </br>

The dataset contains logged traffic accidents provided to the NZTA by the New Zealand Police. It was last updated in August 2023.

## Dashboard inspiration
We plan to use a marker cluster method as seen in image 2 when mapping the logged road accidents to help identify common geographical accident zones and conserve resources. </br>
